// import Route, init, goToRoute from router.js
// NOTE: menu should know about router as it works with it directly. Moreover, macro-bots should know about router
// as long as they user sub-states

// import PR from ../peerRating/index.js

// init(MainMenu extends Route {
//   menu options: {'peer': PR()} // therefore PR() bot instance will have route /peer.
//   handlers: {'go_peer': goToRoute(/peer)}
